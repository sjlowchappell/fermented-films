## Welcome to Fermented Films!

Fermented Films is a one stop shop for a curated evening based on one ingredient. Built using the React library, this project utilizes the MovieDB, CocktailDB, and MealsDB APIs.

Open the app, pick an ingredient theme for the evening, and select your preferred movie genre. We'll curate a meal, drink, and movie combination around your selections. Don't like one of our recommendations? Click "Shake it up!" and we'll find another that suits your needs.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
