## Welcome to Fermented Films!

Fermented Films is a one stop shop for a curated evening based on one ingredient. Built using the React library, this project utilizes the MovieDB, CocktailDB, and MealsDB APIs.

Open the app, pick an ingredient theme for the evening, and select your preferred movie genre. We'll curate a meal, drink, and movie combination around your selections. Don't like one of our recommendations? Click "Shake it up!" and we'll find another that suits your needs.

I really enjoyed this project! It was my second React project and I was able to build upon my learnings from my first React project, Podcastable (https://github.com/sjlowchappell/podcastable). For this project, I challenged myself by using 3 APIs instead of 1 API, and I dove into React Router for the first time. Through this project I flexed my Array method muscles, and learned how to better utilize conditional rendering. I learned how to better split my application into components (which then led me to go back and refactor my first React App to be better component-ized as well).

There were definitely a lot of pain points as I tried to learn how to properly and effectively use React Router, and I continue to struggle with styling (I am not the best designer), but I had great help from fellow developers which greatly accelerated my learning process. Overall, I am very happy with the result!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
